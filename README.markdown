# Janus: Carlhuda's vim Distribution Forked

This has been forked from https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/

I ran into trouble on Ubuntu with the command-t plugin.  I have
modified the Rakefile to use /usr/bin/ruby1.8 which is the proper ruby
version my vim was compiled with.  

I also had to do `sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev`
